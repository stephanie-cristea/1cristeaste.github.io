            <p>In online asynchronous learning environments, students are assigned exercises, but it is not clear how to incorporate the kinds of actions an in-person tutor might take such as explaining, providing more practice, prompting for reflection, and motivating. We explore approaches to adding "Drop-Downs'' that appear after a student submits an answer and that contain additional information to support learning. We conducted randomized A/B experiments exploring the impact of these Drop-Downs on student learning in the online portion of a flipped CS1 course. The deployed Drop-Downs in this course provided explanations, reflective prompts, additional problems, and motivational messages. The results suggest that students benefit from various Drop-Downs in different contexts, indicating the possibility of personalizing content based on the student's state. We discuss the resulting design implications of Drop-Downs in online learning systems.</p>

            <p> An app for an interactive visualizer for Toronto auto thefts using R and the packages Shiny and Leaflet. Users have the option to filter Toronto auto thefts by month, year, and neighborhood to view the density of thefts on a map. Information is also displayed in a bar graph showing the number of theft occurrences per year, and changes based on which neighborhoods have been selected.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for this project came from a statistics course (view repository STA130), where we worked with this data to try to optimize when and where police could station their cars to minimize auto thefts.</p>
            <p>Data was pulled from the Toronto police site.</p>
